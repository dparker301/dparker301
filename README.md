Hi! 👋  
I’m a DevOps and Cloud Engineer who began my tech journey in the late 1990s. Over the years, I’ve held various roles—including Manager, Senior Engineer, Project Manager, and Proposal Manager—working in both the DOD and private sector. Today, I’m concentrating on expanding my cloud expertise.
