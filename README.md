Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a DevOps and Cloud Engineer who began my tech journey in the late 1990s. Over the years, Iâ€™ve held various rolesâ€”including Manager, Senior Engineer, Project Manager, and Proposal Managerâ€”working in both the DOD and private sector. Today, Iâ€™m concentrating on expanding my cloud expertise.
